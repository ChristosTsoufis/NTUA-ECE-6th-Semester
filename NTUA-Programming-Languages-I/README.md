### Lab Exercises for [Programming Languages I](https://courses.softlab.ntua.gr/pl1/) course at [ECE](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en), [NTUA](https://www.ntua.gr/en).
Academic year 2020-2021 (Professor [Papaspyrou](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/staff/71), [Sagonas](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/staff/77))

### **Description**
The main goal of the course is to establish a basic understanding in different types of programming such as:
- Procedural Programming - C++
- Functional Programming - Standard ML nj
- Logical Programming - SWI Prolog 
- Scripting Language - Python 3
- Object Oriented Programming - Java

There were three series of exercises. Each one contained 4 problems. Specifically:

1. The first contained **longest** and **fairmaze** in both **C++** and **SML**
2. The second contained **longest** in **Prolog**, **fairmaze** in **Python** and **qssort** in both **Prolog** and **Python**
2. The third contained **qssort** in **Java** and **round** in both **SML**, **Prolog** and **Java**

More about the problems can be found in the assignements (in Greek).
