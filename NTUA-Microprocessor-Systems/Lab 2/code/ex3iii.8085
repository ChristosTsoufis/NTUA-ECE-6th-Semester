; This program waits for the user to press a button from the hex keybord and prints its 
; hex code in the two right digits of the 7-segment display without using KIND routine.

	IN 10H      ;remove memory protection
	LXI H,0A00H ;address where the array gor the 7-segment display starts
	MVI M,10H   ;set 1st 7-seg display to show nothing, continue till 4th 7-seg
	INX H       ;I point to the block 0A00H...0A05H
	MVI M,10H   ;0A00H will have the print code of 1st
	INX H       ;digit in right and so on. So I want
	MVI M,10H   ;0A00H to 0A03 to have code 10H, so to 
	INX H       ;print nothing.
